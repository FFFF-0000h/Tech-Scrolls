## A

- **abstraction**: one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves filtering out ‚Äì essentially, ignoring - the characteristics that we don't need in order to concentrate on those that we do. _See also [decomposition](#d), [algorithm](#a), [pattern recognition](#p)_.

- **accessibility**: the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
You might also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them equal opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. 

- **active learning**: a training approach in which the algorithm chooses some of the data it learns from.

- **adaptive design**: the way in which a website is built determines how it appears on different devices. Adaptive design creates a website in several different layouts, each suited for different screen sizes. Depending on what device is being used to access the website, the website will adapt and deliver the appropriate layout. _See also [responsive design](#r)_.

- **agile**: the ability to create and respond to change.
 
- **Agile software development**: software development methodologies that focus on iterative development.

- **algorithm**: one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. An algorithm is a plan, a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem. Algorithms are often used as a starting point for creating a computer program, and they are sometimes written as a [flowchart](#f) or in [pseudocode](#p). _See also [pattern recognition](#p), [decomposition](#d), [abstraction](#a)_ 

- **application (software)**: a program or group of programs designed for end users.

- **API (application programming interface)**: what helps different components of software work together so that they all seem to operate as a single software. Such interfaces are very common and help coordinate numerous "moving parts" to make a program or app easy to use.

HTTP is a set of rules and standards for how hypertext files and all kinds of information are transfered over the web. It's how browsers and servers communicate.. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web(www). Without it the Web wouldn't be what it is today. An HTTP URL starts with http:// and has a number 80 port by default. The HyperText part in the name means that there are documents or files involved. Those can contain text, images, graphics, videos or any other media. In addition, they likely contain links to other documents or files for cross referencing, which you can easily access after clicking the link with a mouse or touchpad or after touching it on your phone screen. The Transfer part in the name means the files can move over the World Wide Web from one networked device to another.

## Z

- **zero day**: "Zero-day‚Äù or ‚Äú0Day‚Äù an exploit which is a malicious computer attack that takes advantage of a security hole before the vulnerability is known. This means the security issue is made known the same day as the computer attack is released. In other words, the software developer has zero days to prepare for the security breach and must work as quickly as possible to develop a patch or update that fixes the problem. Zero day exploits may involve viruses, trojan horses, worms or other malicious code that can be run within a software program.
